# Lunit Design System Library

Lunit Design System Library is a collection of reusable components and styles that are used to build Lunit's products. It is built on top of [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/), a popular React UI framework.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @lunit/design-system
```

Material UI is peer dependency of Lunit Design System Library. You need to install Material UI first.

```json
"peerDependencies": {
  "@mui/material": "^5.0.0",
  "@types/react": "^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0",
  "react": "^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0",
  "react-dom": "^17.0.0 || ^18.0.0"
}
```

## Usage

### Theme

This library is based on Material UI's themes feature, so it imports themes and puts them into the provider. We also recommend using the `CssBaseline` component.

```tsx
import {
  createTheme,
  ThemeProvider,
} from '@mui/material/styles';
import CssBaseline from '@mui/material/CssBaseline';
import { themeOptions } from '@lunit/design-system';

const theme = createTheme(themeOptions);

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <CssBaseline />
      <YourApp />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
};
```

If you want to customize the theme, use the `deepmerge` utility.

### Fonts

This library uses the `Pretendard` font-family by default. The [Pretendard font](https://github.com/orioncactus/pretendard) does not come with this library, so you will need to provide it yourself via Webfonts. You can change the font by setting the `fontFamily` property in the theme.

```tsx
const theme = createTheme(
  deepmerge(themeOptions, {
    typography: {
      fontFamily: [
        'Pretendard Variable',
        'sans-serif',
      ]
    }
  })
);
```
