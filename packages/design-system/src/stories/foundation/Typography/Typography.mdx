# Typography

Use typography to present your design and content as clearly and efficiently as possible.


## Usage

### Basic Typography

```tsx
import { Typography } from "@lunit/design-system";
// or
import Typography from "@lunit/design-system/Typography";

<Typography>AI will be the new standard of care. 123456789</Typography>;
```
### Variant

The typography component comes with variants below:

<Canvas
  of={TypographyStories.AllVariants}
  sourceState="none" />

### With styled utility

In some situations you might not be able to use the Typography component. Hopefully, you might be able to take advantage of the [typography](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-typography/#theme) keys of the theme.

<Canvas of={TypographyStories.Styled} />


### With the sx props

You can use all the variants with [the `sx` props](https://mui.com/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/#typography).

<Canvas of={TypographyStories.SXProps} />
