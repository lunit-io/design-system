## Usage

### Typography component

<Canvas>
  <Story id="foundation-typography--typography-component" />
</Canvas>

### With styled utility

In some situations you might not be able to use the Typography component. Hopefully, you might be able to take advantage of the [typography](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-typography/#theme) keys of the theme.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="foundation-typography--styled" />
</Canvas>

### With the sx props

You can use all the variants with [the `sx` props](https://mui.com/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/#typography).

<Canvas>
  <Story id="foundation-typography--sx-props" />
</Canvas>
